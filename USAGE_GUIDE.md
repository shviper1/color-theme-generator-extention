  - Great for cohesive, professional looks

**How to Use:**
1. Set your **Primary** color
2. Click a harmony button (e.g., "Complementary")
3. Watch the other colors update automatically!

#### Step 3: Check Accessibility

The **Contrast Badge** next to the text color shows:
- 🟢 **AAA** - Perfect! Exceeds all standards

**Target:** Aim for at least **AA** level for text.

#### Step 4: Preview

The **Preview** section shows:

Make sure everything is readable!
